## About the Project
This project is focused on predicting the meteorological status of the largest mangrove forest in the world "Sundarban". The major tasks of the project will be, data cleaning, feature selection / extraction, a statistical representation of the data, regression analysis on the data, cross-validation, data visualization, experimental result representation and Conclusion of the result.

Motivation and Objectives:
* This project is focused on predicting the meteorological status of the largest mangrove forest in the world "Sundarban". Sundarban is situated on the southern part of Bangladesh and scientists predicts that it will be sunk within 2050 because of the rise of sea level. 
* As part of fighting global warming, the project members have collected data of the years 1949 to 2015 from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department.
* This project is focused on understanding the meteorological behavior in a statistical way.
* The main objective of this project is to predict the weather of the Sundarban region in the upcoming years and give some insights for future.

## Built With
The project will be developed based on the following tools:
* [Python](https://python.org/)
